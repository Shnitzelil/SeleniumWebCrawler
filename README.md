Using Selenium to do Web Crawling


In this little project we give an idea of using Selenium/WebDriver as a web crawler.
 
1. Clone this project
2. Add your site(s) to the url4crawling.txt file
"Site name=http://www.siteurl.com"
3. Provide the system property for the suitable driver (e.g. webdriver.chrome.driver, webdriver.ie.driver or webdriver.remote.server and etc.)
4. Run ApplicationCrawler class as JUnit Test
